# Mobile Robot Localization using Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)
This project demonstrates how to localize a mobile robot in 2D using the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The simulation combines motion modeling, sensor fusion (GPS + odometry), and noisy control input to estimate the robot's trajectory in real-time.

# Project Overview
This Python-based project simulates a robot navigating in 2D space and estimates its position using:

- True state (ground truth)

- Dead reckoning (noisy control input)

- GPS measurements (noisy observations)

- Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for sensor fusion and localization

The simulation shows how the EKF corrects noisy predictions using noisy measurements and produces a much more accurate estimate of the robot's path.

   ```bash
   python main.py
You should see a live animated plot comparing the true, estimated, and dead reckoning paths.

# Features
‚úÖ Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) implemented from scratch
Includes both prediction and correction steps with motion and observation model linearization using Jacobians.

‚úÖ Nonlinear kinematic motion model
Simulates a realistic bicycle-like robot model with position, orientation, and velocity.

‚úÖ Noisy control input simulation
Emulates real-world motor uncertainty by adding Gaussian noise to velocity and yaw rate commands.

‚úÖ GPS-like noisy observation model
Uses simulated noisy measurements to represent imperfect real-world sensors.

‚úÖ Covariance propagation and Kalman gain computation
Proper uncertainty handling using prediction and innovation covariance matrices (P, S).

‚úÖ Real-time animation with uncertainty ellipses
Visualizes evolving state estimates along with uncertainty using 2D Gaussian ellipses.

‚úÖ Dead reckoning vs. EKF comparison
Highlights the benefits of sensor fusion by comparing pure odometry with EKF estimates.

‚úÖ Modular code structure for reusability
Separated into motion/observation models, EKF logic, and plotting utilities for clarity and extension.

‚úÖ State and measurement history tracking
Maintains trajectory data for analysis, plotting, or post-processing.

‚úÖ Support for batch simulation
Easily adaptable for offline data simulation or log replay scenarios.
   
# Future Work

- Use real sensor data (e.g., from a GPS module or IMU)

- Implement SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)

- Replace motion model with differential drive

- Test different noise levels or maneuvers
